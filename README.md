# Course Work Project for Web Technology Module


_**What is the purpose of this web-site?**_
The Track Evaluation company specializes in providing freight shipping <br>
solutions whenever and wherever. As an independent freight agency,<br>
the company has access to one of the largest logistics networks in the industry, 


## _**Brief explanation:**_

To create this site, I used the standardized markup language <br>
"html" and for styling "css", I also used basic <br>
"js" skills in the process of creating the site, for example: <br>
instructions "if" and of course "else" - It is executed when the condition is false and of course the "function"       with the names of the parameters.
While on styling I used Media queries for many things,<br>
such as: 
- width and height of the viewport 
- width and height of the device 
- orientation (is the tablet/phone in landscape or portrait mode).
